# Musical_Time_Machine
Simple program that asks you for a date, scrapes the Billboard Top 100 for that date and then puts those songs into a Spotify Playlist


In order to use this, there is a couple things you'll need to do
- Create your own spotify account
- Setup Spotify OAuth and get your access token
- Find you CLient_id and Client Secret on your spotify developer dashboard and replace it with that. 


This is still a WIP, there are a few issues with the sp.search functionality i'm still working through. Sometimes it will just not find certain songs
(Can't Feel My Face by The Weeknd) for example. So i'm still messing with the search line to get it fine the songs properly.
